Bootstrap Feature Widgets
=========================

A WordPress plugin which creates a Widget to display a featurette with a super-sized glyphicon, a title, content or latest posts and a link. The output requires [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) to display properly.

The plugin assumes that you're already using Bootstrap, so you need to load the Bootstrap CSS separately.

* [Download Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Bootstrap WordPress Theme](http://320press.com/wpbs/)
* [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/) _(hotlink CSS and javascript files)_

You can download this plugin from the WordPress repository: [Bootstrap Feature Widgets](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bootstrap-feature-widgets/)
